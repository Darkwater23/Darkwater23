Greetings!

I'm @Darkwater23

I've been doing computer-related things since I was a kid on my dad's Franklin ACE 1000 and his Tandy.

I've built PCs, repaired servers, wired networks by hand, administered servers and built numerous applications.

I've coded in Perl, PHP, Java, VB, C#, VB.NET, JS and probably a few others.

I'm a jack-of-trades technologist. I transistioned into leadership several years ago from a senior .NET developer.

I just recently setup my github account and I'm starting to put my personal projects up here.

See you around the inter-tubes!
